Add and/or generate tokens
- Should generate the token, the date, and what it was used for
- Probably should only be generate, but this late in the game I could instead
  shot the ones I generated into the database by hand

Add promo codes
- Need to have the code, generation date, and app version?

Add app/app versions?
- Could this be a way to tie everything together?


A token represents a free download of an app
Redeeming a token should assign it the oldest valid promo code for the app
A promo code is valid if:
  1. It is 28 days or less old (now < generated_at + 28 days)
  2. It's app status is 'Ready for Sale' or 'Pending Developer Release' (is_valid = true)
  3. It has not yet been assigned to a token (token_id = null)
If a valid promo code is not available the user should receive an error
An email should be sent when the number of valid promo codes is less than the
  number of unclaimed tokens


Overcommit = (# unclaimed tokens - # unclaimed promo codes) / # unclaimed tokens

1. Add 80 tokens for the section match - 80 tokens overcommitted (100%)
2. Add 60 promo codes for MR-1.3.55 - 20 tokens overcommitted (25%)
3. 40 tokens are redeemed from the section match - 20 tokens overcommitted (50%)
4. Add 20 tokens for MMG - 60 unclaimed tokens (67%)
5. MR-1.3.56 becomes ready for release, add 100 tokens
